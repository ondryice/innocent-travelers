# About
**Innocent Travelers** is a non-profit organization that aims to provide foster-care children with a suitcase to pack their belongings for the transition to a new home.
Most children are given **thirty minutes** and a *trash bag* to collect everything they own.
This is tragic, and the purpose of the website is to provide information on the issue, as well as how one can help with the problem.

## Website Goals
The goal of this website is to provide a means to help these children, as well as raise awareness of the problems with current foster-care practices.

# How to Contribute
Currently, the best way to contribute is to raise your local awareness of the problem.
We are currently working on the overall design of the site, and will post changes to the [design documents](./docs/design).
We welcome any help from contributors, but cannot guarantee that your work will be used; further, we will always prioritize the work of team members over the work submitted by non-team-members.
