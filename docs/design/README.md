# Etiquette
### File Types
PDF is the preferred file type, though PNG and JPG also work well.

### File Naming
There should only be two types of documents in this directory:
- Page layouts and designs
- Component designs

#### **Page designs**
```
page_{PageName}.{file-extension}
```
Page designs should follow this naming convention.
For example, `page_Home.pdf`, `page_About.png`, or `page_ContactUs.pdf`.

#### **Component designs**
```
comp_{componentName}.{file-extension}
```
Component designs should follow this naming convention.
For example, `comp_Navbar.png` or `comp_HeroSection.pdf`.
